This is the contribution for the peer assessment of the 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course in the 'Data Science Specialization' of the user gunbra.


Follow the instructions below to perform the analysis that will provide two plain txt files (data_all.txt and data_tidy.txt) containing 
(1) the entire data set with all variables for all subjects and activities merged from the training and the test data and 
(2) a subset of the full data set only containing averages by subject and activity of variables refering to mean() or std(). 


### Instructions:  
*  Get the data from 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip'. 
*  Extract the zip archive 'getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip'.
*  Copy the script 'run_analysis.R' to the directory './UCI HAR Dataset', which was created by unzipping the downloaded archive.  
*  Run the script 'run_analysis.R'. It will do the entire anaylisis and generate the two txt files containing the reaaranged/ analized data.

Refer also to the files README.txt and features_info.txt, which are provided in the zip archive, for more information on the original data set.
